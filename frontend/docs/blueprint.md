## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: #5DADE2 (RGB: 93, 173, 226). This light blue reflects the calm, connected, and trustworthy nature of a social platform. Its brightness ensures it can act as a highlight color in the overall layout.
- Background color: #F5F9FC (RGB: 245, 249, 252). A very light tint of the primary blue; nearly white but provides subtle separation and visual calmness.
- Accent color: #76D7C4 (RGB: 118, 215, 196). A light, analogous green to the primary that conveys freshness and dynamism; should be used sparingly to guide the eye and call attention to elements such as calls to action.
- Body font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font providing a clean, modern and highly readable style that is appropriate for continuous text. Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a sans-serif font to highlight titles.
- Use flat, modern icons with a consistent line weight. Icons should primarily use the primary color (#5DADE2) or a desaturated version of it.
- Emphasize a clean, card-based layout to organize content. Use consistent spacing and padding to create a visually appealing and easy-to-navigate interface.
- Implement subtle animations and transitions to provide a smooth user experience. For example, use fade-in effects for loading content or a slide-in effect for notifications.
